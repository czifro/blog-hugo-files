## My assigned character {#my-assigned-character}

I was born a human and I'm supposed to live on the planet till my body gives up and it's no longer suitable for sustaining the social construct that one would call "life"...or at least I am said so. I reserve my right to have speculations about this whole "dying"-thing. I popped in existance in the alsmost ex-soviet republic of Bulgaria where I've spend good portion of my development into a fully fledged and normally functioning humanoid. After almost a fifth of a century there I've decide to change my general location to the vicinity of central Europe. Germany to be more precise. Here I am currently studying Computer Science at the [Karlsruer Institut fÃ¼r Technologie (KIT)](https://www.kit.edu/). I quite like it here as for now it's the place that allows me to extend my skillset, knowledgebase and general level of awesomeness through learning about how computers work, how to tell them what you want them to do and other fun things about the surrounding world (humans included)


## Relevant interests I've chosen {#relevant-interests-i-ve-chosen}

As previously implied the delusion I've chosen to believe in is that I'll do CS related things till the rest of my conscious earth-life. With the years(I am not that old, just obnoxious) I've developed interest in some narrower areas in the "computer world".

1.  Special place in my heard is dedicated to Artificial Intelligence. No, not only the Machine Learning parts. The whole thing! The things in [Artifcial Intelligence: A modern approach](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/). Not only the parts are only rough and massive number crunching by CPU cores but also the parts that are plain old beauty. The parts that model the human brain. The parts that....here have that quote:

    > Algorithms, enabled by constraints, exposed by representations that support models, targeted at thinking, perception and action -- [Patrick Winston](https://www.csail.mit.edu/person/patrick-winston)

    I believe that this section deserves its own subsection! So, over the years I've acquired tastes for:

    -   Computer vision and image processing and evaluation - I've had several times to write my own computer vision/image processing library in java at the time(but then some horrible events happened to my code base :( ).
    -   Machine Learning...duuuh. Different types of perceptrons, neural networks, regression models, classification models, trees, support vector machines, deep networks..etc. Many of those I've implemented once for myself and for sake of learning and understanding how everything works
    -   Linear Programming - while most people hated the course where this thing is learned at uni, I kinda loved it. [Simplex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex_algorithm) can be quite the gem. Sadly, I am yet to implement it for myself.
    -   Generic Algorithms
    -   Natural Language Processing
    -   Autonomous agents and group behaviours - Man, [this book(The nature of code)](https://natureofcode.com/) blew me away in an unimaginable ways. Not exactly exactly AI, but still!!
    -   Statistical Inference - Yep, probability theory can also be a absolutely beautiful thing if you manage to push past the dumb "statistics".

        As much as I loved AI, I only had opportunity to have the time and necessity to learn bout all the cool tools that exist in the python ecosystem that enable you to make awesome machine learning and AI applications. Libraries and tool-kits as _numpy_, _SciKit-learn_, _Tensorflow_, _Keras_, _Eward_...etc
2.  Computer Graphics/Game engine design - as every naive young boy at one point of my life I wanted to make games for living. Unfortunately I was also kinda smart enough to actually start doing something even thou I had no idea what was I doing. The first engines that I've "used" were Unity, Unreal Engine 3 and... Macromedia Studio 8. Myeah, that last one is a thing that existed and it's not game engine at all but hell, I was pretty much making a flash game on it. Over the years my focus shifted and transitioned to programming but my interest in games stayed. Thanks to that, at some point I picked up a little OpenGL, a little general 2D/3D Rendering and concepts and good amount of making a rudimentary engine that can run a "game". At uni I took a course in Computer Graphics where I learned a whole lot of other interesting topics such as ray tracing, realistic image generation, seep-up structures, colors and others. As far I'm concerned - I still find everything in the subject incredibly exciting.
3.  EMACS! [EMACS](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) is everything. Emacs is a operating system...lacking a decent text editor but still. At my first job I saw my supervisor using it and then a guy told me not to touch that ever. But I did! And I hated it! It was so dumb. Then I kinda forced myself to use it as every other editor/IDE sucked for c++. I spend good couple of days configuring Emacs and...I made it usable. Then I stated investing more and more and it became second nature. An extension of my hands, If you will. And....now I am writing this blog with Emacs so... yeah. Be sure to check out my configuration file.
4.  Web Development - it's one of the things where you learn even that you don't want. I am not proud with myself with this one but hey, it impresses the employers :/. I have my fair share with AnuglarJS, VueJS, Bootstrap, Foundation, JQuery, ExpressJS and other little and big JavaScript libraries.
5.  Some quickies that I've picked in recent times
    -   Operating systems in general, Linux in general(Debian for live!) - It <span class="underline">really</span> help to know what is happening on OS-level when writing c++.
    -   CPU-Design and what happens in the computer of relatively low level - a lot of effects that happen on transistor-ish level are exploitable in code, if you know they exist, of course.
    -   Compiler Design - that one course at uni! Compilers are technological marvels, lexers and parsers are fucking awesome.
    -   Functions optimization, Non-linear optimization, Computational linear algebra, Numerical analysis - I am kinda sucker for math. In my defense being a bigger nerd doesn't really hurt your career.
    -   Lambda calculus - a computational model that has completely different way of thinking about. I love it. I fund the whole idea interesting, "fresh", mind boggling and.....just different and unconventional. I am kinda sucker for those too.


## Supported Languages {#supported-languages}

-   Java, C++, python, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, elisp(but pretty meh)
-   Haskell, Prolog
-   PHP(but pretty back in the time), Scala(but only as "stage"...like "emo stage" or something), Processing(it's only a toy but still)


## Technologies {#technologies}

-   git
-   Tensorflow, SciKit-learn, Jupytor
-   Cmake, make, g++, Robot Operating System(ROS), RabbitMQ
-   JavaFX/Java-Swing, JUnit, Maven
-   Frontend(AngularJS, VueJS), Backend(NodeJS, Express), Websockets, Karma, Jasmine, SQL
-   LaTeX, Emacs Org-mode, UML


## Current work {#current-work}

-   In the process of writing my Bachelor thesis that has to do with Machine Learning, stochastic probability models(Bayesian Neural Networks and Mixture of Gaussian Process Experts) and data from pollution sensors. One of my supervisors currently working in [HITS](https://www.h-its.org/en/) and those guys absolutely blew my mind with their research groups and institute so yeah, of course I am going to namedrop them here.
-   Working as a research assistant(yes, so pretentious) in [Fraunhofer IOSB](https://www.fraunhofer.de/en.html). I deal mainly with "intelligent systems"
-   At Uni I am currently participating in a Practical Course about drawing curves(with BSplines) in the plane, doing tricks with them(finding parallel curve, crating closed curve, interpolating curve) and extending those to surfaces(tensor product surfaces)


## Previous work {#previous-work}

-   Practical course in software development - I an five other people developing a Software product(Web App) following the waterfall methodology(it's really better when you are knew to everything)
-   Algorithms Teaching assistant in [KIT](https://www.kit.edu/) - teaching basic data structures, algorithms for sorting, graphs and spanning trees, complexity, algorithm analysis and algorithm engineering. Also, again, checking homeworks.
-   Linear Algebra Teaching assistant in [KIT](https://www.kit.edu/) - teaching a bunch of people about basic mathematical notation, group theory, rings, bodies, vector spaces and some other things. Also checking homeworks of said people.
